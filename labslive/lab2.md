## Video: Setting up a Simple Flow

> The following video outlines the process to create a simple flow. The video uses a generic example. You will use the naming convention of `EP_<ID>_wxcclab` where `<ID>` is your attendee ID provided. This is to keep a track of all the configuration created end to end.

> The video serves as a reference. The steps are detailed below the video if you would like a snapshot of what configuration is required.

## Detailed Steps

### 1. Copy out the flow and configure the advanced flow

- Open the Portal > Routing Strategy > Flow page.
- Copy the existing flow flow_wxcclab and edit the copied flow - name it advanced_flow1_wxcclab
- Edit the flow to go into flow designer.
- Ensure that you configure the Menu steps with a 3 option - 2 queue, 1 Blind Transfer step.
- Ensure you configure all the fields in the menu step including the prompts and the entry timeout (requires you to explore all options on the step).
- Ensure you configure all the blind transfer location to Cisco Toll Free : +18005536387 â€“Note: This will actually connect you to the live toll free number!

### 2. Configure the Queue Treatment loop and Opt Out and Callback steps

- In Flow Designer - Configure the Queue treatment for the first queue. Use the queueCounter variable and configure the Opt out steps including the high volume message and the callback step.
- Configure the voicemail destination to the same external number above.
- Validate the flow and publish it.

### 3. Point to the New flow in the Routing Strategy

- Go to the routing Strategy page > Routing Strategy > EP_voice_wxcclab
- Once the flow is published, configure the Entry Point Routing strategy to point to the new flow advanced_flow1_wxcclab.

### 4. Test the end to end flow

- Login to the agent desktop and go Idle (Not Ready)
- Test Queue treatment by going not ready on the agent desktop.
- Call the main number on the entry point and go into the queue. You should hear the queue twice and then have an option to leave a callback.
- leave the callback and the call should end.

### 5. Execute the Callback
- Have the agent go ready after you left a callback.
- They should receive the callback call.
