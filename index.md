In the table below you can find the agenda of the lab and some referred links, where you will find more details about each lab section.

## Lab Objective

This lab will help you configure a voice contact end to end and receive it on the agent desktop, with advanced Customer Experience flow design using our brand new Flow Designer solution.
The lab will also contain multiple deep dive and advanced exercises using Flow Designer to help you design diverse types of Customer Experience flows.
