Welcome to the Lab Guide Library for the 2021 Cisco Live! This is the **"HOLCCT-2107: New WebEx Contact Center Flow Designer - Deep Dive"** lab. 

In the table below you can find the agenda of the lab and some referred links, where you will find more details about each lab section.

## Lab Objective

This lab will help you configure a voice contact end to end and receive it on the agent desktop, with advanced Customer Experience flow design using our brand new Flow Designer solution.
The lab will also contain multiple deep dive and advanced exercises using Flow Designer to help you design diverse types of Customer Experience flows.

**IVR Prompts**

We will use a static prompts that have already been uploaded for you some exercises. If you would like to use dynamic TTS (Text-to-speech) prompts, you can refer to the Bonus section - Lab 5 - or use the [preinstalled TTS conector using our Resources Link](https://cisco.box.com/s/oakd708czpfe0cpcgc3fd08o7ulxd9hw). This is a Cisco TTS account that can be used for the duration of the lab. This TTS account will be revoked after the lab.

**Lookups, Advanced Queue Treatment, Screen-pops, CCAI**

We have chosen specific areas of focus for advanced scripting topics. We have HTTP Request lookups, advanced queue treatment, screen pops, CCAI, and more. For additional queries or use cases that you may have received for business use-case, please feel free to reach out to us (proctors) to consult.
CCAI Connectors (TTS and CCAI) can be found [here](https://cisco.box.com/s/oakd708czpfe0cpcgc3fd08o7ulxd9hw).
